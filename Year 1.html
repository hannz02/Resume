                <p> My Year 1 was a little special from others because I started this course online, all was very new to me, despite all these, I still managed to finish it with style, semester 1 was a little hard on me because I was still new, but that is no reason for me to give up there.<p>
                <p> The style I was talking about was that I still managed to get certifications for the courses I attended through out the semester, the certifications below are proof that I managed to survive through the semester online.<p>

                <p> Semester 2 was like my first semester being physical around the school, there were some adjustments that I had to make so that I would fit in better, not only the environment, but the courses as well as I am moving from Penang to Kuala Lumpur to attend the classes physically.</p>
                <p> I finished all my courses as well but I decided to go and compete for my first hackathon, although I didn't place in the competition, I do think that this is a great experience for me as I go to know what to expect in such competitions.</p>
