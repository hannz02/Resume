                    <p>I have been working as a part timer at this company for a time now. I was working as a part of the customer service team, I started working here since the year 2020 immediately after finishing my SPM Exams. <p>
                    <p>What I normally do on a day-to-day basis is that I would handle new inquries from the customers on various social media platform. For example, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. </p>
                    <p>Other admins would be busy with administration work and would not have time to explain our operations to the new customers, so this is where I come into play. </p>
                    <p>I would explain the classes we have here, make sure that each and every one of the customers is crystal clear, then I would assist them to register for the classes they want. </p>
                    <p>I might started out small as only a part-timer here, but I have involved in many ceremonies with the company</p>
                        <h4><b><ins>Ceremonies</ins></b></h4>

                            <p style="text-align:center"> The loyalty award I got for being with the company for over 2 years!</p>
                            <br></br>

                            <br></br>
                            <img src="Images/CSTuitionCentreNanYang2.jpg" alt = "This doesn't look good for me, but I did attend the ceremony with the team" style = "float:middle;max-width:100%;height:400px"></img>
                            <p style="text-align:center"> The education award that the company got!</p>
                <h3 style = "font-size:200%"><b>2023-Present</b></h3> 
                    <p>Now that I have been working long enough and since the company is expanding, I have made my own customer service team to handle the customers coming in on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>I would have three other colleagues working with me right now to handle the massive workload, making sure that the business does not lose any customers. I would lead my team to make sure that everything runs smoothly with minimal complaints. </p>
                    <p>Even if there are complaints, we would handle them with care and settle it as soon as possible so that the customers would be satisfied. </p>
                <h3 style = "font-size:200%"><b>Thoughts</b></h3> 
                    <p>I do think that this company would have the capability to be one of the best in the industry, the staffs here are hardworking, diligent and I do hope that I could still serve my part to help the company to reach greater heights in the field<p>
